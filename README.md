# Helloooooo Github 👋

I’m Will — an AI engineer, systems builder, and founder.  
I care about leverage, clean abstractions, and building technology that actually works in the real world.

I spend most of my time designing AI-powered data systems: LLM + SQL layers, agent workflows, internal tools, and automation that turn messy business data into usable intelligence.

This channel is where I share what I’m building, what breaks, and what actually holds up in production.

## Work

I run **General Development (general.dev)** — an AI enablement studio for serious operators.

We build:
- AI data wrappers (LLM ↔ SQL ↔ business logic)
- Internal AI tools & dashboards
- Agent-based workflows (classification, analysis, decision support)
- Production-grade AI systems (not demos)

A lot of this work lives at the intersection of AI, data engineering, and product thinking.

I also run **Cardinal eCommerce**, where we apply the same systems thinking to complex Shopify + subscription infrastructure — but AI is now the center of gravity.

## What I’m Interested In

- Applied LLM systems (not hype)
- Agent architectures & orchestration
- Data modeling for AI
- Automation that compounds
- Building small, sharp teams
- Long-term leverage over short-term hacks
